## El Niño – Southern Oscillation
__About the Indicator__  
The El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the most prominent modes of natural climate variability in the North Pacific.  ENSO cycles, which typically last 6 - 18 months, are known to impact Pacific fisheries, including tuna fisheries, because they cause interannual changes in sea surface temperature and phytoplankton abundance.

The Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) is a measure of ENSO phase that focuses on ocean temperature, which has a direct effect on these fisheries.  

Understanding the effects of natural climate variability like ENSO on the ocean, marine ecosystems, and fisheries is an active area of research.

__Status of the Indicator__  
The Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) indicated La Niña conditions throughout `r RptYr`. In `r RptYr`, the ONI ranged from `r monthly_min_RptYr` to `r monthly_max_RptYr`.  This is within the range of values observed previously in the time series.

__Indicator Data__  
Description: The three-month running mean (referred to as a season) of satellite remotely-sensed sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Niño 3.4 region (5°S – 5°N, 120° – 170°W). The Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) is a measure of the El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase. Warm and cool phases, termed El Niño and La Niña respectively, are based in part on an ONI threshold of ± 0.5 °C being met for a minimum of five consecutive overlapping seasons. Additional atmospheric indices are needed to confirm an El Niño or La Niña event, as the ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon. The atmospheric half of ENSO is measured using the Southern Oscillation Index.

Timeframe: Three-month running average.

Region/Location: Niño 3.4 region, 5°S – 5°N, 120° – 170°W.

Measurement Platform: *In-situ* station, satellite, model.
